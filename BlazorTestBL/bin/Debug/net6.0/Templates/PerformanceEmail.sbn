Dear {{employee.LName}} {{employee.FName}}

Your performance between the {{GetPerformanceStart().ToShortString()}} and {{GetPerformanceEnd().ToShortString()}} was {{IsSumTicketsGood() ? "Good" : "Not Good"}}.
You handled {{SumTicketsFromAmount()}} {{IsSumTicketsGood() ? "More" : "Less"}} than needed.

Thank you
